Password Manager Script

Overview:
This is a simple password manager that uses AES-256-CBC encryption to securely store, retrieve, and manage passwords.

Features:
1. Add a new password.
2. Retrieve a password.
3. List all stored accounts.
4. Delete a password.
5. Export passwords to a file.
6. Import passwords from a file.
7. Show Help.
8. Exit the program.

How to Use:
- On first run, the script will prompt you to set a master password.
- The master password is used to encrypt and decrypt your password store.
- You can add, retrieve, list, delete, export or import your passwords from the main menu.
- The encrypted password store is saved as `passwords.enc` in the same directory.
- The file with the imported passwords has to end with a newline.

Security Considerations:
- Use a strong master password (at least 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
- The export file contains passwords in plaintext; handle it securely and delete it when no longer needed.
